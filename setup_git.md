* https://gist.github.com/john-auld/a55ffe44e9965623f530cb487e33cebd
* When add key: ssh-add testkey instead of adding the path
* push origin master not working

### Branching
Here is the resolve the conflict and pulled request to local

Now here I add more comment to create conflication in the resolve_conf_branch

I made another change in main after I made one in resolve_conf_branch. this will result in a conflict, 
just like I make a branch and another teammate made a change to the master at the same time. 

The above result is the resolved result
